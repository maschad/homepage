### Body

I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined [Atoma Network](https://atoma.network) — a visionary project redefining the future of artificial intelligence through decentralization, confidential computing, and a staunch commitment to privacy in a completely transparent way. This is all a part of the journey towards data sovereignty.

The rise of AI has unlocked unprecedented potential, but it has also exposed critical flaws in today's centralized infrastructure: opaque data practices, proprietary lock-in, and erosion of user control. Atoma Network addresses these challenges head-on by building a distributed network of nodes that empowers individuals and organizations to run any non-proprietary AI model with full privacy guarantees by leveraging advanced Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and confidential VMs to provide confidential computing.

I think this opens up a window for more collaborative and transparent AI. When users have cryptographic guarantees that their data remains private through TEEs, they can safely collaborate on model optimization and training techniques without compromising sensitive information. This creates a powerful feedback loop - privacy guarantees enable more open sharing of improvements, which in turn makes AI systems more robust and effective for everyone. This aligns perfectly with my long-standing advocacy for user sovereignty, where individuals can both protect and derive value from their data.

In the long run, as the network grows and nodes become more accessible - potentially even running on phones - this distributed infrastructure could dramatically reduce the need for centralized data centers. This shift towards distributed computing not only makes AI more cost-effective for companies but also more environmentally sustainable through better resource utilization. The network effect is powerful: privacy enables collaboration, collaboration improves efficiency, and distributed scale makes AI more accessible and sustainable for everyone.

I'll be focusing on strengthening Atoma's core infrastructure—scaling its peer-to-peer networking layer, optimizing node resilience, and ensuring seamless, secure collaboration across the network - all while building in the open.

I think in order to move decentralization from being just a buzzword, we need to have applications that people will use daily, and in the current landscape, LLMs tools and agents are quickly becoming a part of our daily lives.

[Utopia](https://utopia.xyz) is one such application that demonstrates an immediate use case of Atoma's infrastructure. Utopia.xyz  allows users to interact with typical AI tools using most of the popular open source LLMs, without having to run their own infrastructure.

For years, I've championed the idea that software should serve users first, not corporations. Centralized AI platforms today vacuum up personal data, lock users into proprietary ecosystems, and obscure how decisions are made. Atoma flips this paradigm. By enabling individuals to run models across a trust-minimized network, we're putting control back where it belongs: in the hands of users, developers, and communities.

This isn't just about technology—it's about ethics. When AI operates transparently and confidentially, we unlock its potential to solve real-world problems without compromising fundamental rights. Our implementation of TEEs and confidential VMs ensures that this privacy isn't just a promise—it's a mathematical guarantee.

The road ahead is challenging, but the stakes couldn't be higher. I'm joining Atoma Network because it represents a bold step toward a future where AI is both transformative and respectful of human autonomy. Whether you're a developer interested in building on our TEE infrastructure, a researcher exploring privacy-preserving AI, or simply someone who values data sovereignty, I invite you to explore Atoma's journey—and perhaps join us in shaping what comes next.
