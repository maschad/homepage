# Traditional Church Decline in Jamaica

The decline of Traditional churches across the Anglophone world reflects complex interactions between religious practice and political economy that transcend purely liturgical analysis. While the previous article’s examination of Jamaica's ecclesiastical landscape has revealed important cultural dynamics, the phenomenon demands broader consideration of political dimensions that influence religious evolution—a perspective scholars like Barry Chevannes and Robert Bellah have valuably explored. The waning influence of Traditional churches cannot be reduced to Eurocentric aesthetics, as developments in American Christianity and its spread to other countries demonstrate. For instance, the rise of Christian Nationalism across various non-Mainline protestant American churches could hardly be attributed to Afro-centric liturgical elements.

Moreover, characterizing Traditional Jamaican churches as "quiet" overlooks their liturgical innovations. The majority of Jamaica Council of Churches members - including Baptist, Anglican, United, Roman Catholic, Methodist and other Protestant churches - have integrated Reggae and Revival hymns into their services, although to what degree may vary by parish. Father Ho Lung's incorporation of Caribbean music into worship stands as a prominent example of this successful hymnal indigenization. Through these efforts, Traditional churches have created worship experiences that authentically emerge from and celebrate local musical traditions.

Paradoxically, many newer Jamaican churches have largely eschewed these indigenous innovations in favour of adopting North American musical styles—ranging from Hillsong, whose contemporary worship music sonically emerges from American pop traditions, to African-American Gospel, which often appropriates Caribbean musicality. A telling example is Donnie McClurkin's rendition of "I've Got My Mind Made Up," which has gained widespread acceptance in Jamaican churches. This phenomenon reveals a deeper cultural dissonance within Jamaican Christianity: an internalized colonial perspective encapsulated in the Jamaican expression "nutten good nuh come outta Jamaica". This mindset suggests that local cultural expressions require foreign, particularly American, validation before gaining acceptance within their own religious contexts.

The relationship between American cultural imperialism and Jamaican religious institutions reveals a telling contrast. Traditional denominations, having developed local governance structures, largely operate independently of American institutional control, though this independence often translates to limited material support from their American communicants. The sustained vitality of evangelically influenced and non-denominational churches across Jamaica reflects not only their successful theological adaptation to neoliberal capitalism but also their financial backing from affiliated American religious organizations. These institutions have reconstructed traditional doctrinal frameworks—especially eschatological understandings about personal salvation that mainline churches have largely abandoned—creating theologies around personal achievement that align seamlessly with contemporary market-driven individualism. Meanwhile, Traditional churches in Jamaica—parallel to their Mainline Protestant counterparts in America—have preserved their historical commitment to leftist politics and collectivist ethics, evidenced in the uncompromising voices of religious leaders from Ernle Gordon to now Mariann Budde. However, the post-Cold War ascendancy of neoliberal capitalism, captured in the pointed Jamaican aphorism "yuh cyaa nyam morality," signals a pragmatic shift away from socialist ideals that has left Traditional churches increasingly marginalized.

This current relationship between religious transformation and socioeconomic change echoes themes first explored in Weber's seminal work, "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism." Where he argued that Calvinist understandings of the world played a role in galvanizing many North Europeans to engage in enterprising secular work against the backdrop of Roman Catholic contentment. Though both Protestantism and Capitalism have evolved substantially since Weber's analysis, his methodological approach to understanding their mutual influence remains invaluable for comprehending the contemporary religious dynamics.

Traditional churches' disconnection from contemporary Jamaican society primarily reflects an institutional failure to react to a fundamental shift in the sociopolitical ideology of a post-structural adjustment Jamaica. As Deborah Thomas astutely observes, we must understand capitalist consumption within specific historical and political-economic contexts. For Jamaica's Black working class, individual economic advancement represents a powerful form of self-actualization after centuries of systematic dehumanization. While newer churches' success in delivering material liberation to their congregants remains uncertain, we see their individualistic spiritual ethos finding more effective expression and subsequent materialization outside Christianity, particularly in “scam” spirituality.


The embrace of perceived Afrocentric spiritual traditions by "scammers" reveals complex intersections of religious practice, economic resistance, and historical memory. Consider Jamal's "Ballondor" lyric, "we sacrifice Goat fi get the big notes," which synthesizes ancient West African purification rituals with an Old Testament hermeneutic of a transactional God. This theological fusion represents more than mere spiritual syncretism—it embodies a recasting of economic resistance through religious practice, echoing historical patterns of religious-political resistance akin to Obeah in Jamaican history. This demonstrates how black working class Jamaicans have reinterpreted ancient West African spiritual technologies adapting them to contemporary needs, challenging the tendency to label certain practices as exclusively "Afro," when in fact they represent a complex liturgical heritage that spans multiple religious traditions. Traditional churches might find valuable insights in examining this current synthesis of spiritual practice, economic resistance, and class liberation, particularly as they grapple with their own lack of appeal to the working class and lack of external support.

The traditional church must fundamentally reimagine its relationship with working-class Jamaican cultural expressions and economic aspirations. Rather than maintaining a posture of moral superiority that treats these expressions - particularly through modern dancehall, alternative economic activities and sexual attitudes - as inherently sinful or requiring reformation, churches must recognize these as legitimate responses to historical dehumanization and ongoing marginalization. This requires moving beyond mere tolerance to active engagement and learning from these communities' innovative spiritual and cultural practices. The goal isn't to 'rehabilitate' these expressions to fit middle-class Christian sensibilities, but to acknowledge them as valid forms of human agency and spiritual expression born from Jamaica's specific historical context. True inclusion means creating space for working-class Jamaicans to authentically participate in religious life without having to abandon their cultural identity or conform to imported American Christian norms.

Traditional churches face a profound challenge in contemporary Jamaica, where, as Orlando Patterson notes, "combative individualism" has deep historical roots in the social fabric. However, the growing limitations of neoliberal capitalist systems are becoming increasingly apparent, particularly when contrasted with the emergence of alternative socio-political models. China's evolution as a Unitary Marxist-Leninist Socialist Republic offers a compelling case study in this regard. While the precise theoretical relationship between "Socialism with Chinese characteristics" and classical Marxist thought merits its own detailed analysis, China's comprehensive societal transformation presents a remarkable paradox in the context of religious social doctrine. Their achievements span an extraordinary breadth: from establishing global leadership in artificial intelligence research to pioneering advances in electric vehicle technology, from creating world-class public infrastructure to ensuring universal access to healthcare and education. This technological and social progress is complemented by their continued role as the world's manufacturing centre and with their growing dominance in social media platforms. Most significantly, China has accomplished what many considered impossible: lifting over 800 million citizens out of poverty while pursuing international development partnerships that stand in stark contrast to historical patterns of Western imperialism and colonialism. In what might be considered a profound historical irony (or an exposé of hypocrisy), this officially atheist state has perhaps achieved the most comprehensive practical realization of Catholic Social doctrine's vision for human dignity and the common good that any nation has yet manifested.

This paradox suggests that the pendulum of global ideological discourse may be swinging back toward an appreciation of collectivist social frameworks. For Traditional churches, this shifting landscape presents an opportunity to reframe their spiritual commitment to egalitarian empowerment in contemporary terms, demonstrating how religious institutions can contribute to reimagining social solidarity in an era where more and more western societies are increasingly skeptical of pure libertarianism.
